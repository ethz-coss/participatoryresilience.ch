# coci_hackathon_website

Short overview page for the CoCi Hackathon 2022.

### How to customize
This site runs fully statically and is hosted in the most simple html-css-js stack possible.

For basic customizability a large configmap gets parsed into a html by a python script.

### Usage
`python main.py templates out values.yaml`


## NB:
Since the move to the new location at ethz-coss/participatoryresilience.ch the repo is missing deploy keys necessary for github actions.
