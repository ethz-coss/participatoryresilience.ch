section2:
  title: Challenges
  subtitle: You will work on the following topics
  content_items:
    - title: Sensor Design
      subtitle: Designing a sensor for environmental monitoring
      image: iot.jpeg
      description: The current prototype has a modular design and several functionalities ranging from particulate matter measurement to light intensity measurement. The goal of this task would be to improve the usability of the sensing device by either improving the current hardware configuration or adding new functionalities.
    - title: 3D modelling
      subtitle: 3D modelling for enclosure design
      description: 3D printing has revolutionized the way people create products for personal and commercial use. It is now much easier for businesses and individuals to turn their ideas into reality without having to spend a lot of money. You can design 3D printing products yourself using 3D model or Cad software and send them to your 3D printer for printing. We have developed a basic CAD model for the enclosure of IoT device. How can it be made more user friendly? How can the design be made more modular to allow so that it can be used for indoor and outdoor environmental monitoring.

    - title: Data Representation
      subtitle: Data visualization is critical in "making sense of data."
      description: The goal is to provide a quick and efficient method of communicating data, identifying trends, and flagging data inconsistencies. The current version of the IoT device displays color coded data on the LED screen to provide users with visual feedback. The goal of this task would be to improve the user interface. The teams could focus on issues such as. Which data does the user want to see? How can it be presented in a user-friendly manner on the device as well as on the data visualization platform? Which representation results in behavior change?

    - title: Data Analytics
      subtitle: Data Science techniques have changed the way we handle sensor data.
      description: Several data science tools and packages are available that can be used to get insights from heterogeneous and unstructured sensor data. These tools can be used to create open-source cross-platform applications that enable both novices and experts to visualize, interpret, and statistically analyze their data in meaningful ways. We created the exploreR (RShiny-based) application, which allows users to analyze their data without any programming knowledge. The goal is to either improve the application's functionality or create a new user-friendly application that allows for easy analysis of sensor data.

    - title: Data Integration
      subtitle: Integrating into an existing open-source platform
      description: The tool is most useful if it is integrated into an existing open-source platform. Like open street map, for example. Which open access platforms can you think about? Which ones do you think would be useful?
