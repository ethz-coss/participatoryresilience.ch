    text: |
      This is a Block Course for ETH students that is organized as a hackathon. It will allow students to showcase their innovative spirit through different projects. The fast-paced structure of the course produces an atmosphere of creativity and collaboration as makers work in teams of up to five to create their product. Teams will be provided with easy-to-use technology (RaspberryPi, Arduino, etc.), tools, materials, co-working space and mentorship to turn their ideas into reality.

section2:
  title: Challenges
  subtitle: You will work on the following topics
  content_items:
    - title: Sensor Design
      subtitle: Designing a sensor for environmental monitoring
      image: challenges/iot.jpeg
      description: The current prototype has a modular design and several functionalities ranging from particulate matter measurement to light intensity measurement. The goal of this task would be to improve the usability of the sensing device by either improving the current hardware configuration or adding new functionalities.
    - title: 3D modelling
      subtitle: 3D modelling for enclosure design
      description: 3D printing has revolutionized the way people create products for personal and commercial use. It is now much easier for businesses and individuals to turn their ideas into reality without having to spend a lot of money. You can design 3D printing products yourself using 3D model or Cad software and send them to your 3D printer for printing. We have developed a basic CAD model for the enclosure of IoT device. How can it be made more user friendly? How can the design be made more modular to allow so that it can be used for indoor and outdoor environmental monitoring.

    - title: Data Representation
      subtitle: Data visualization is critical in "making sense of data."
      description: The goal is to provide a quick and efficient method of communicating data, identifying trends, and flagging data inconsistencies. The current version of the IoT device displays color coded data on the LED screen to provide users with visual feedback. The goal of this task would be to improve the user interface. The teams could focus on issues such as. Which data does the user want to see? How can it be presented in a user-friendly manner on the device as well as on the data visualization platform? Which representation results in behavior change?
      image: challenges/datarep.jpeg
    - title: Data Analytics
      subtitle: Data Science techniques have changed the way we handle sensor data.
      description: Several data science tools and packages are available that can be used to get insights from heterogeneous and unstructured sensor data. These tools can be used to create open-source cross-platform applications that enable both novices and experts to visualize, interpret, and statistically analyze their data in meaningful ways. We created the exploreR (RShiny-based) application, which allows users to analyze their data without any programming knowledge. The goal is to either improve the application's functionality or create a new user-friendly application that allows for easy analysis of sensor data.
      image: challenges/analytics.jpeg
    - title: Data Integration
      subtitle: Integrating into an existing open-source platform
      description: The tool is most useful if it is integrated into an existing open-source platform. Like open street map, for example. Which open access platforms can you think about? Which ones do you think would be useful?

  content_items:
    - question: Do I need to have any specific qualifications to be a participant for the Hackathon?
      answer: If you love to code, prototype hardware solutions, you are more than welcome to participate in the Hackathon.
    - question: How do I submit what I have made for the Hackathon?
      answer: You have to develop the application, software, hardware, etc. on your local system and submit it to https://github.com/ethz-coss along with instructions to run the application and source code.
    - question: Do we need to have the entire idea fully working?
      answer: The entire idea need not be fully implemented however, the submission should be functional (e.g. small scale) so that it can be reviewed by the lecturers.
    - question: Will you provide hardware components, prototypes and DB for us to kick-off on ideas?
      answer: Yes, we will provide standard hardware and more specific hardware on request. We provide sample code and db.
    - question: Do I need to give a demo for the product that I have built?
      answer: Yes, the demo is part of the requirements to earn the ECTS.
    - question: Who will own the IP (Intellectual Property) Rights to the product that I have built?
      answer: The developer/developers of the product will have all rights and own the IP of the product. However, all code needs to be in public domain (open source) so that it can be evaluated by the judges.
